PHASE 1 — ASYNC INTERVIEW LOOP
Goal: implement session → question → audio upload → transcription → analysis pipeline.

Implement:
- POST /session/start (create session in D1)
- GET /session/:id/next-question (OpenAI Responses API)
- POST /session/:id/answer (R2 audio, Workers AI Whisper)
- POST /analysis/:answerId (OpenAI evaluation)
- GET /session/:id/results

Files modified:
- worker/modules/ai/prompts.ts with interview prompts
- worker/modules/chat/ index.ts replaced with interview handlers
- worker/db/schema.ts extended for sessions/questions/answers/analysis.
