PHASE 2 — TONE & PROSODY
Goal: extract pace, pitch variance, silence %, filler words.

Implement:
- Audio metrics extraction using AudioContext offline analysis (client) or DSP approximations (server).
- Store metrics in D1: volume_avg, pitch_var, speed_wpm, filler_count.
- Combine metrics with GPT evaluation.

Modify:
- worker/db/schema.ts (add audio_metrics table)
- worker/modules/ai/prompts.ts (add tone scoring request)
