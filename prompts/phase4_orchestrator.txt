PHASE 4 — ORCHESTRATOR WORKER
Goal: job-hunt pipeline automation using Cloudflare Agent (Tasks model).

Implement:
- New worker module orchestrating: JD parse → resume tailoring → interview prep → mock sessions.
- Durable Object to store orchestrator state.
- /pipeline/start, /pipeline/status endpoints.
