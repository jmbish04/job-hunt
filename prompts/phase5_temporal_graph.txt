PHASE 5 — TEMPORAL GRAPH
Goal: store relationships between session → question → answer → analysis over time.

Implement:
- Graph schema (nodes: session, question, answer, competency; edges typed)
- Build ingestion script reading from D1
- Expose /graph/query for strengths-over-time, competency trajectory.
